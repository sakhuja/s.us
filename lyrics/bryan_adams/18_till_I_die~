Wanna be young - the rest of my life
Never say no - try anything twice
Til the angels come - and ask me to fly
Gonna be 18 til I die - 18 til I die
Cant live forever - thats wishful thinkin
Who ever said that - must of bin drinkin
Dont wanna grow up - I dont see why
I couldnt care less if time flies by

18 til I die - gonna be 18 til I die
Ya it sure feels good to be alive
Someday Ill be 18 goin on 55! - 18 til I die

Anyway - I just wanna say
Why bother with what happened yesterday
Its not my style - I live for the minute
If ya wanna stay young - get both feet in it - 18 til I die
A lil bit of this - a lil bit of that
lil bit of everything - gotta get on track
Its not how ya look, its what ya feel inside
I dont care when - I dont need ta know why
18 til I die - gonna be 18 til I die
Ya it sure feels good to be alive
Someday Ill be 18 goin on 55! - 18 til I die
Ya theres one thing for sure - Im sure gonna try

Dont worry bout the future
Forget about the past
Gonna have a ball - ya were gonna have a blast
Gonna make it last
