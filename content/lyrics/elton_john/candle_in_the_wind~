Lyrics by bernie taupin
Available on the album goodbye yellow brick road

Goodbye norma jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that marilyn was found in the nude

Goodbye norma jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our marilyn monroe
