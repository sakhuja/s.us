Hey, mr. seeker hold on to this advice
If you keep seeking you will find
Dont want to follow
Down roads been walked before
Its so hard to find unopened doors
Are you ready? are you ready?
Hey, mr. hero walking a thin, fine line
Under the microscope of life
Remember your roots, my friend
Theyre right down below
cause heroes come and heroes go
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Count down to the change in life thats soon to come
Your life has just begun
