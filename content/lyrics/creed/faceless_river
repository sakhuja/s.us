I spent a day by the river
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature
To remind me of all thats real
Its funny how silence speaks sometimes when youre alone
And remember that you feel
Again I stand, lord I stand, against the faceless man
Now I saw a face on the water
It looked humble but willing to fight
I saw the will of a warrior
His yoke is easy and his burden is light
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do whats right
Again I stand, lord God I stand, against the faceless man
cause if the face inside cant see the light
I know Ill have to walk alone
And if I walk alone to the other side
I know I might not make it home
Again I stand, lord I stand, against the faceless man
Next time I see this face
Ill say I choose to live for always
So wont you come inside and never go away
