When Im dreaming Im guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
Cause I dont want to leave the comfort of this place
Cause theres a hunger, longing to escape
From the life I live when Im awake

So lets go there
Lets make our escape
Come on; lets go there
Lets ask can we stay?

Chorus
Can you take me higher?
To the place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To the place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But my friend Id sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the earth and my dreams the same

The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate
So lets go there
Lets make our escape
Come on
Lets go there lets ask can we stay

Chorus

Lets go there
Lets go there
Lets go there
Lets ask can we stay

Up high I feel like Im alive for the very first time
Sat up high Im strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
X2

Chorus x2
