Drivin home this evening
I coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt

Then I heard it on the street
I heard you mighta found somebody new
Well who is he baby - who is he
And tell me what he means to you

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That youd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
It cuts like a knife
But it feels so right

Theres times Ive bin mistaken
Theres times I thought Id bin misunderstood
So wait a minute darlin
Cant you see we did the best we could

This wouldnt be the first time
Things have gone astray
Now youve thrown it all away

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
It cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
